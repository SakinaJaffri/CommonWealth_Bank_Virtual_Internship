# Commonwealth Bank Data Science Simulation ðŸ’¼

## Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world experience with Commonwealth Bankâ€™s Data Science team, focusing on data management, engineering, and privacy practices. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in handling sensitive information, designing robust data systems, and optimizing data-driven decision-making processesâ€”especially in the context of social media and unstructured data.

## Project Objectives  
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Build pipelines to aggregate and process structured and unstructured datasets for actionable insights.  
- **Personal Data Anonymization**: Implement anonymization techniques using **Python** to protect personal information in compliance with data privacy laws.  
- **Database Design**: Propose well-structured database schemas and documentation for efficient information storage and retrieval.  
- **Social Media Data Analysis**: Recommend analysis strategies for deriving insights from social media datasets.  
- **Privacy & Compliance**: Emphasize responsible data handling through privacy-first approaches.

## Project Deliverables  
- **Data Engineering Pipeline**: A structured flow for collecting, cleaning, and transforming data.  
- **Anonymized Dataset**: Sample dataset with sensitive fields masked or removed using Python to ensure privacy compliance.  
- **Database Schema Proposal**: Blueprint for scalable and efficient data storage.  
- **Social Media Insights Report**: Recommendations for analyzing engagement and trends using social data.  
- **Privacy Compliance Summary**: Overview of data handling aligned with regulatory standards.

## Key Insights  
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: Well-designed pipelines streamline data flow and enhance insight generation.  
- **Data Protection**: Python-based anonymization is critical in safeguarding user identity without compromising analytical value.  
- **Schema Optimization**: Clean database structures boost retrieval speeds and maintainability.  
- **Unstructured Data Utilization**: Social media data, when processed correctly, reveals valuable behavioral trends.  
- **Privacy Alignment**: Adhering to privacy best practices ensures both compliance and user trust.

## Strategic Recommendations  
- **Invest in Automation**: Enhance future workflows with automated data processing and validation tools.  
- **Privacy-First Design**: Embed anonymization and security into data systems from the outset.  
- **Leverage Unstructured Data**: Broaden analytics scope to include social media and user-generated content.  
- **Documentation Culture**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all datasets and systems.
